# Hi, I’m Jenny

## Why You Should Hire Me
I’m an experienced educator turned edtech professional with a talent for analyzing how people learn and how technology supports that process.  
After years in K–12 classrooms and on assessment development teams, I’ve developed a sharp eye for quality that catches subtle inaccuracies, unclear prompts, or logic gaps before they reach learners.  

I bring educator expertise that can only be developed through years in the classroom, along with the curiosity and adaptability to learn any tools, technologies, or processes needed to excel in this role. I look for patterns and make recommendations that make products smarter and more effective. Whether I am evaluating AI-generated lesson plans or refining multiple-choice questions for accuracy and rigor, I bring curiosity, precision, and a teacher’s perspective to every project.

### Fun Fact
Before transitioning to edtech, I led science fairs, gifted programs, and virtual learning initiatives. These experiences taught me how to turn complex ideas into engaging learning moments. Now, I am channeling that same creativity into improving the next generation of AI tools for education.
