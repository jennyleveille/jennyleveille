# Assessment Evaluation

## Prompt / Input
**Grade Level:** 3rd  
**Standard:**  CCSS.Math.Content.3.G.A.1
Understand that shapes in different categories (e.g., rhombuses, rectangles, and others) may share attributes (e.g., having four sides), and that the shared attributes can define a larger category (e.g., quadrilaterals). Recognize rhombuses, rectangles, and squares as examples of quadrilaterals, and draw examples of quadrilaterals that do not belong to any of these subcategories.  
**Type of Assessment:** Multiple Choice

## Reflections

This assessment fully covers all aspects of the standard within the constraints of being a multiple choice assessment. Questions are clear and developmentally appropriate. They assess a range of understanding from basic recall of what a quadrilateral is to analyzing differences between types of quadrilaterals, which will provide the teacher with strong data for next steps.

### Suggested Improvements
- Ideally, a question or two would include an image of a shape.
